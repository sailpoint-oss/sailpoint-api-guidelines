# Legacy content map (maintainers)

This document tracks coverage between the legacy published guidelines and the rewritten docs site.
It is maintainer-focused and intentionally not part of the public docs navigation.

## Covered today (rewritten docs)

- **Rules**: normative requirements grouped by category under `/docs/rules/*` (IDs preserved).
- **Guides**: non-normative patterns and examples (now split into curated guide pages).
- **Search + rules.json**: stable deep links and tooling integration.

## Missing / thin vs legacy (high priority)

- **Principles**: covered at `/docs/principles`, but can be expanded with more concrete examples and tradeoffs.
- **Conventions**: covered at `/docs/conventions`, but can be expanded with linting + review workflow details.
- **Appendices**: rebuilding common recipes and reference material; additional legacy items may still be missing.

## Thin rule categories to expand first

- **Requests & Querying**: add concrete filter/sort templates and examples.
- **Pagination**: add contract defaults, max limits, stable ordering guidance, and examples.
- **HTTP Semantics + Errors**: add concrete Problem Details payloads + error schema patterns.
- **Security & Authorization**: add OpenAPI security patterns and example scope naming.
