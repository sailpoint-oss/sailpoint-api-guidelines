    "proposedText": "**Intent**: reduce payload complexity and improve evolvability.\n\nAPIs SHOULD minimize deeply nested object structures.\n\n**Preferred patterns**:\n\n- Use references to separate resources (IDs or links) instead of embedding full graphs.\n- If you embed related data, embed only a small, stable summary (e.g., `{id, name}`), not the full related object.\n\n**When nesting is acceptable**:\n\n- Small, intrinsic value objects that are not meaningful as standalone resources (e.g., `address`, `coordinates`).\n- Stable summary/reference shapes.\n\n**Anti-patterns**:\n\n- Deeply nested graphs where changes to one domain object ripple into many responses.\n- Embedding large sub-objects that make pagination/filtering/patching difficult.\n",
    "rationale": "Deep nesting makes responses brittle and hard to evolve, and it increases payload size and coupling across services.",
