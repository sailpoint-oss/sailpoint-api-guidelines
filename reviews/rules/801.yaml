    "proposedText": "**Intent**: avoid unit ambiguity and enable interoperable duration handling.\n\nDurations and time intervals SHOULD use ISO 8601 formats.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- `PT15M` (15 minutes)\n- `PT1H30M` (1 hour, 30 minutes)\n- `P7D` (7 days)\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n- ❌ `900` (is that seconds? ms?)\n- ❌ `1h30m` (non-standard)\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- OpenAPI examples show ISO 8601 strings for duration fields.\n",

    "Add more examples and explicitly call out the unit ambiguity problem with numeric durations."
