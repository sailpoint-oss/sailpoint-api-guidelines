    "proposedText": "**Intent**: make the API intuitive for customers/partners and stable across internal refactors.\n\nResource names MUST reflect domain concepts and business terminology rather than technical implementation details.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `/accounts`, `/entitlements`, `/identity-profiles`, `/access-requests`\n- ❌ `/dbUsers`, `/tblEntitlements`, `/internalAccounts`, `/accountJpaEntities`\n\n**Guidance**:\n\n- Prefer stable nouns that match product language.\n- Avoid leaking internal system names, database table names, or service names.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- A domain expert can recognize what the resource is without knowing internal architecture.\n",
    "rationale": "Domain names reduce churn: internal implementation changes shouldn’t force public URL renames. They also improve discoverability and developer experience.",
