    "proposedText": "**Intent**: keep the URL space stable and expressive via HTTP methods.\n\nPrefer noun-based URL paths. Avoid verbs in paths; use HTTP methods to express the action.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `DELETE /accounts/{accountId}`\n- ✅ `POST /accounts` (create)\n- ❌ `GET /accounts/{accountId}/delete`\n- ❌ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/get`\n\n**If you need a workflow/action**:\n\nRepresent it as a noun-like sub-resource (a request/job):\n\n- ✅ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/disable-requests`\n- ✅ `POST /exports` (export job)\n- ❌ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/disable`\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- Paths describe domain nouns; verbs appear only in HTTP methods.\n",
