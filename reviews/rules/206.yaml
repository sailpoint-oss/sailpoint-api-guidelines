    "proposedText": "**Intent**: keep clients stable and reduce long-term operational burden.\n\nPrefer **compatible evolution** over breaking changes. Do not treat “we can bump the version” as the default approach to making changes.\n\n**Guidance**:\n\n- Prefer additive changes:\n  - add optional fields\n  - add new endpoints\n  - add optional query parameters with safe defaults\n- Only introduce a new version when you have a clear, unavoidable breaking change and a migration plan.\n\n**Common anti-patterns** (avoid):\n\n- Breaking an endpoint and \"fixing\" it by bumping the version, even though the change could have been additive.\n- Creating a new version without a deprecation timeline for the old one.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- Changes include a compatibility assessment (what breaks, who is affected, and how migration works).\n",
