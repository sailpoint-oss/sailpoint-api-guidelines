    "proposedText": "**Intent**: reduce enumeration risk and avoid leaking internal scale/ordering.\n\nAPIs MUST NOT expose sequential numeric identifiers as public resource IDs.\n\n**Why**:\n\n- Sequential IDs are easy to enumerate/scrape.\n- They leak business scale and internal ordering.\n\n**Preferred alternatives**:\n\n- UUID/ULID/GUID (opaque string IDs).\n- Non-sequential natural keys only when they are truly stable and non-sensitive.\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- This rule is about *public identifiers*. Internal database surrogate keys may be sequential; do not expose them directly.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- Resource IDs shown in URLs and payloads are non-sequential and not trivially enumerable.\n",
    "rationale": "Public sequential IDs are a common source of data scraping and privacy leaks, even when authentication exists.",
    "compatNotes": "Guidance. Legacy APIs may require migration/aliasing; do not silently change IDs without a compatibility plan."
