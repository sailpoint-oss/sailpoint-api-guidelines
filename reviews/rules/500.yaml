    "proposedText": "**Intent**: keep public URLs clean and avoid redundant, implementation-driven path segments.\n\nAvoid redundant base path segments like `/api` in public-facing URL paths.\n\n- Prefer configuring environment-specific base URLs via OpenAPI `servers`.\n- Prefer meaningful, domain-driven resource paths (see [#506]).\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `https://example.sailpoint.com/v2026/accounts`\n- ❌ `https://example.sailpoint.com/api/v2026/accounts`\n\n**Note**:\n\n- This guidance is part of overall URL hygiene; see [#501] for normalization and canonical path rules.\n",
    "rationale": "Including `/api` is usually redundant and leaks internal implementation conventions into public contracts. Cleaner base URLs improve developer experience and reduce churn when infrastructure changes.",

    "Keep the idea but treat it as URL hygiene; align it with #136 to avoid isolated \"common sense\" rules."
