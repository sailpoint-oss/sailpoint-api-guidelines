    "proposedText": "**Intent**: keep APIs learnable and prevent uncontrolled surface area growth.\n\nKeep the number of distinct resource types manageable to reduce cognitive load for API consumers.\n\n**Warning signs**:\n\n- Many resources differ only by a small flag or view.\n- You have multiple resources that represent the same domain concept (synonyms).\n- Clients routinely need to call many endpoints to do one workflow.\n\n**Refinement guidance**:\n\n- Consolidate near-duplicate resources by using query parameters, field filtering (`fields`), or embedding (`embed`) where appropriate.\n- Prefer a small set of well-designed core resources supporting filters/sorters over many narrow endpoints.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- New resource introductions include rationale and alternatives considered (extend existing vs add new).\n",
    "rationale": "API sprawl makes integration harder and increases maintenance costs. Thoughtful consolidation improves usability and consistency.",
    "compatNotes": "Consolidation should be done via additive evolution + deprecation; avoid removing widely used resources without a migration plan."
