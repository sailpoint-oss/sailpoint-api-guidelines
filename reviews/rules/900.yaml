    "proposedText": "**Intent**: reduce payload size and improve performance without creating many bespoke endpoints.\n\nSupport a `fields` query parameter to allow clients to request only specific fields in the response.\n\n**Rules**:\n\n- Field filtering MUST NOT apply by default.\n- `fields` MUST be explicitly documented (allowed values and syntax).\n- Prefer a simple, consistent syntax, e.g. `fields=(id,name,status)`.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `GET /accounts/{id}?fields=(id,name,status)`\n- ✅ `GET /accounts?fields=(id,name)&limit=50&offset=0`\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- Treat `fields` as part of the cache key for GET requests.\n- If nested selection is supported, document limits and behavior.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- Docs include examples and explain what happens when an unknown field is requested.\n",
    "rationale": "Field selection helps clients optimize bandwidth and improves perceived performance while preserving a stable resource model.",
    "compatNotes": "Adding `fields` is additive. If you implement it, keep syntax stable across endpoints."
