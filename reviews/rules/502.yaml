    "proposedText": "**Intent**: keep APIs consistent, predictable, and aligned with HTTP semantics.\n\nPrefer resource-oriented endpoints over RPC/action-style endpoints. Model operations as HTTP verbs applied to resources.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `POST /accounts` (create an account)\n- ✅ `PATCH /accounts/{accountId}` (update an account)\n- ❌ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/update`\n- ❌ `GET /accounts/{accountId}/disable`\n\n**When you really need an action**:\n\nPrefer creating a noun-like **command/request resource** rather than embedding a verb:\n\n- ✅ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/disable-requests`\n- ✅ `POST /access-requests` (request resource)\n- ❌ `POST /accounts/{accountId}/disable`\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- New endpoints can be explained as a noun resource + standard HTTP method semantics.\n",
