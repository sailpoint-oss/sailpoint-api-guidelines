    "proposedText": "**Intent**: prevent tenant leakage and keep URLs stable across customer renames.\n\nPublic APIs MUST NOT embed customer org names or tenant identifiers in URL path structures.\n\n**Why**:\n\n- Org names can change and are not stable identifiers.\n- Embedding tenant identifiers increases data leakage risk and complicates caches/logs.\n\n**Preferred approach**:\n\n- Determine tenant/org scope from authentication context (token claims) and/or standard headers.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `GET /accounts` (scope inferred from auth context)\n- ❌ `GET /customers/acme-corp/accounts`\n- ❌ `GET /orgs/{orgName}/accounts`\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- Internal-only administrative APIs may have different constraints; this rule applies to public, customer-facing APIs.\n",
