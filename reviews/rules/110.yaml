    "proposedText": "**Intent**: make endpoints predictable and self-describing.\n\nCollection endpoints MUST use plural resource names.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ `GET /accounts` (collection)\n- ✅ `GET /accounts/{accountId}` (single resource)\n- ✅ `GET /identity-profiles` / `GET /identity-profiles/{identityProfileId}`\n\n**Anti-examples**:\n\n- ❌ `GET /account` (ambiguous)\n- ❌ `GET /Accounts` (wrong casing)\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- Use domain language and stable nouns (see [#506]).\n- If a term is uncountable (rare), pick a consistent convention and document it.\n\n**Testability**:\n\n- New resources follow plural collection naming consistently.\n",
