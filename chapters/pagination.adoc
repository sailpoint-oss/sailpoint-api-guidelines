[#159]
== {MUST} support pagination 

Access to lists of data items must support pagination to protect the service
against overload as well as for best client side iteration and batch processing
experience. This holds true for all lists that are (potentially) larger than
just a few hundred entries.

There are two well known page iteration techniques:

* https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results[Offset/Limit-based
  pagination]: numeric offset identifies the first page entry
* https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/pagination[Cursor/Limit-based] — aka
  key-based — pagination: a unique key element identifies the first page entry
  (see also https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results[Facebook’s guide])

The technical conception of pagination should also consider user experience
related issues. As mentioned in this
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/pagination-infinite-scrolling-load-more-buttons/[article],
jumping to a specific page is far less used than navigation via {next}/{prev}
page links.

We currently prefer to use https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results[Offset/Limit-based pagination].

**Note:** To provide a consistent look and feel of pagination patterns,
you must stick to the common query parameter names defined in <<137>>.


[#161]
== {MAY} use pagination links where applicable

To simplify client design, APIs should support simplified hypertext
controls for paginating over collections whenever applicable as follows

[source,json]
----
{
  "self": "https://myorg.api.identitynow.com/v3/resources?cursor=<self-position>",
  "first": "https://myorg.api.identitynow.com/v3/resources?cursor=<first-position>",
  "prev": "https://myorg.api.identitynow.com/v3/resources?cursor=<previous-position>",
  "next": "https://myorg.api.identitynow.com/v3/resources?cursor=<next-position>",
  "last": "https://myorg.api.identitynow.com/v3/resources?cursor=<last-position>",
  "query": {
    "query-param-<1>": ...,
    "query-param-<n>": ...
  },
  "items": [...]
}

*Remark:* You should avoid providing a total count unless there is a clear
need to do so. Very often, there are significant system and performance
implications when supporting full counts. Especially, if the data set grows
and requests become complex queries and filters drive full scans. While this
is an implementation detail relative to the API, it is important to consider
the ability to support serving counts over the life of a service.
