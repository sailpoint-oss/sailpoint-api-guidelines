[#138]
== {SHOULD} avoid actions — think about resources

REST is all about your resources, so consider the domain entities that take part in web service interaction, 
and aim to model your API around these using the standard HTTP methods as operation indicators.  For example, 
rather than creating a specific action for completing a certification campaign, prefer to use PATCH to 
update the completed status of the campaign.

Request

[source,http]
----
PATCH v1/campaigns/{campaignId}
----

Body

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/completed",
        "value": true
    }
]
----

This example uses JSON Patch, where each operation specifies an `op` (operation type such as 
"replace", "add", "remove"), a `path` (JSON Pointer to the target field), and a `value` (the new value 
to apply). This format provides a standardized way to express partial updates to resources.

Sometimes, standard HTTP methods aren’t specific enough to indicate the action you wish to perform on a 
resource, or there is complex business logic on the back end that can’t be satisfied by PATCHing a single 
field.  In these cases, it is advisable to use the following URI format for specific resource actions:

Request

[source,http]
----
POST v1/campaigns/{campaignId}/remediation-scan
----

[#140]
== {SHOULD} define _useful_ resources

As a rule of thumb resources should be defined to cover 90% of all its client's
use cases. A _useful_ resource should contain as much information as necessary,
but as little as possible. A great way to support the last 10% is to allow
clients to specify their needs for more/less information by supporting
filtering and <<157, embedding>>.


[#141]
== {SHOULD} keep URLs verb-free

The API describes resources, so the only place where actions should appear is
in the HTTP methods. In URLs, use only nouns. Instead of thinking of actions
(verbs), it's often helpful to think about putting a message in a letter box:
e.g., instead of having the verb _cancel_ in the url, think of sending a
message to cancel an order to the _cancellations_ letter box on the server
side.


[#142]
== {MUST} use domain-specific resource names

API resources represent elements of the application’s domain model. Using
domain-specific nomenclature for resource names helps developers to understand
the functionality and basic semantics of your resources. It also reduces the
need for further documentation outside the API definition. For example,
"sales-order-items" is superior to "order-items" in that it clearly indicates
which business object it represents. Along these lines, "items" is too general.


[#228]
== {MUST} use URL-friendly resource identifiers: [a-zA-Z0-9:._\-/]*

TBD


[#143]
== {MUST} identify resources and sub-resources via path segments

Some API resources may contain or reference sub-resources. Sub-resources should be
referenced by their name and identifier in the path segments as follows:

[source,http]
----
/resources/{resourceId}/sub-resources/{subResourceId}
----

In order to improve the consumer experience, you should aim for intuitively
understandable URLs, where each sub-path is a valid reference to a resource or
a set of resources. For instance, if
`/partners/{partnerId}/addresses/{addressId}` is valid, then, in principle,
also `/partners/{partnerId}/addresses`, `/partners/{partnerId}` and
`/partners` must be valid. Examples of concrete url paths:

[source,http]
----
/shopping-carts/de:1681e6b88ec1/items/1
/shopping-carts/de:1681e6b88ec1
/content/images/9cacb4d8
/content/images
----

**Note:** resource identifiers may be build of multiple other resource
identifiers.

**Exception:** In some situations the resource identifier is not passed as a
path segment but  via the authorization information, e.g. an authorization
token or session cookie. Here, it is reasonable to use **`self`** as
_pseudo-identifier_ path segment. For instance, you may define `/employees/self`
or `/employees/self/personal-details` as resource paths --  and may additionally
define endpoints that support identifier passing in the resource path, like
define `/employees/{emplId}` or `/employees/{emplId}/personal-details`.


[#145]
== {SHOULD} consider using (non-)nested URLs

If a sub-resource is only accessible via its parent resource and may not exist
without parent resource, consider using a nested URL structure, for instance:

[source,http]
----
/shoping-carts/de/1681e6b88ec1/cart-items/1
----

However, if the resource can be accessed directly via its unique id, then the
API should expose it as a top-level resource. For example, customer has a
collection for sales orders; however, sales orders have globally unique id and
some services may choose to access the orders directly, for instance:

[source,http]
----
/customers/1637asikzec1
/sales-orders/5273gh3k525a
----


[#320]
== {MUST} not use sequential, numerical IDs

Numerical, sequential IDs are considered a security risk because malicious actors can 
enumerate through the IDs to obtain unauthorized information.  API producers must 
use GUIDs or natural keys that aren’t sequential.


[#146]
== {SHOULD} limit number of resource types

TBD


[#147]
== {SHOULD} limit number of sub-resource levels

There are main resources (with root url paths) and sub-resources (or _nested_
resources with non-root urls paths). Use sub-resources if their life cycle is
(loosely) coupled to the main resource, i.e. the main resource works as
collection resource of the subresource entities. You should use <= 3
sub-resource (nesting) levels -- more levels increase API complexity and url
path length. (Remember, some popular web browsers do not support URLs of more
than 2000 characters.)
