== Pull requests only

*DON'T* push to the main branch directly. Always use pull requests and
let people discuss changes in pull request.

Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been
concluded and at least 2 reviewers gave their approvals.

== Changelog for major changes

When your pull request does major changes, please also add an entry to
the changelog.

== Rule IDs

Each of the rules has an unique ID. A Rule ID is immutable and durable. It
doesn't change until the content of the rule changes significantly so that
it does not make sense to identify it with the old Rule ID.

Rules are authored as Markdown/MDX under `content/docs/rules/`.
Each rule heading must end with a numeric ID (e.g. `[#148]`).

To validate uniqueness and generate the rule index:

[source,bash]
----
npm run generate:rules
----

To generate a new unique Rule ID, run:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/new-rule-id.sh
----
