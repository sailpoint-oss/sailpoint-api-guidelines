# Compatibility checklist

Use this checklist when changing an existing API. It focuses on the common ways teams accidentally
break clients.

## Generally safe (often compatible)

- Adding optional response fields.
- Adding new endpoints or new optional query parameters.
- Adding new enum values (if clients tolerate unknown values).
- Adding new error types (when status codes and contract are stable).

## High risk (often breaking)

- Removing fields or changing field meaning.
- Changing required/optional status for existing fields.
- Tightening validation of existing inputs (rejecting values previously accepted).
- Changing default sorting/pagination behavior in a way that alters client-visible results.
- Changing error schema shape or semantics without a versioning/migration plan.

## Checklist for a proposed change

- What existing clients might rely on this behavior?
- Is the change additive? If not, what is the migration plan?
- Are examples updated in OpenAPI to match the new behavior?
- Are changes called out in release notes/changelog?
