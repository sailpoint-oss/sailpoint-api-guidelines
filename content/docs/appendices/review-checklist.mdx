# Review checklist

Use this checklist during design reviews, PR reviews, or pre-release audits. It’s intentionally
short—use it to find the right area, then dive into the relevant Rule category.

## Contract and docs

- Is OpenAPI complete (parameters, request/response schemas, and examples)?
- Are error responses documented and consistent?
- Are breaking changes avoided or explicitly handled?

## Security

- Are authentication and authorization requirements clearly documented per operation?
- Are least-privilege scopes/permissions used?
- Are sensitive details avoided in logs and error payloads?

## HTTP semantics

- Do methods and status codes match semantics (GET safe, PUT idempotent, etc.)?
- Are caching/concurrency headers used appropriately where needed?

## URLs and resource modeling

- Are resources named consistently and predictably?
- Are identifiers stable and representation shapes coherent?
- Are relationships represented without deep nesting unless necessary?

## Requests, querying, and pagination

- Is default ordering stable?
- Are pagination defaults and limits documented?
- Are filtering/search parameters documented with examples?

## Payload conventions and common objects

- Are timestamps and formats consistent (RFC 3339, etc.)?
- Are enums and optional fields handled consistently?
- Are null/empty semantics clear?
