# Glossary

This glossary defines terms used across the API Guidelines so teams and integrators share the same
language.

## Terms

### Resource

An addressable domain concept exposed via the API (e.g., an `account`, `role`, or `campaign`), usually
represented as JSON and identified by a stable identifier.

### Representation

The JSON shape you exchange over the wire for a resource (often a subset/variant of an internal domain
model).

### Compatibility (backwards compatibility)

The ability for existing clients to continue working without code changes. Additive changes are
typically safe; semantic changes often are not.

### Idempotency

A property where repeating the same request has the same effect as making it once (or yields the same
result). Important for safe retries.

### Optimistic locking

A concurrency pattern that detects conflicting updates (commonly using HTTP preconditions like
`ETag`/`If-Match`) and fails writes when the resource changed since the client last read it.

### Cursor pagination

Pagination using an opaque token (“cursor”) that points to a position in a result set, typically used
for large or rapidly changing datasets.
