title: SailPoint API Guidelines
description: Start here—how to use the Rules and Guides to design consistent, secure, evolvable APIs.
---

This site is a public hub for SailPoint's API style and design guidelines—built to help teams ship
consistent, secure, evolvable APIs for customers and partners.

## Start here

If you're new, begin with this page, then choose a path:

- **Designing a new API**: read the core principles, then work through the Rules categories as you model
  resources, errors, pagination, and security.
- **Reviewing an API**: use the Rules as a checklist (each rule has a stable ID you can cite in review
  comments and docs).
- **Implementing an API**: follow the Rules for the normative “must/should” requirements; use Guides for
  rationale and examples.
- **Integrating with SailPoint APIs**: use the Rules as a contract checklist and the Guides for practical
  patterns (pagination, errors, retries) and terminology.

## What's in this hub?

### Rules (normative)

Rules are the authoritative guard rails. They use RFC 2119 language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) and preserve
stable numeric IDs for durable references.

- [Browse all Rules](/docs/rules)

### Guides (non-normative)

Guides explain intent and provide patterns and examples that help teams apply the Rules.

- [Read Guides](/docs/guides)

### Appendices (reference)

Appendices provide reusable reference material: glossaries, checklists, and recipe-style guidance.

- [Browse Appendices](/docs/appendices)
