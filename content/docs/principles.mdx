# Principles

These principles explain *why* the rules exist and how to make tradeoffs when designing APIs for
customers and partners.

## API as a product

Treat the API as a first-class product:

- Define the target audience and primary use cases.
- Optimize for clarity and long-term maintenance, not internal implementation convenience.
- Assume your consumers will integrate slowly and upgrade cautiously—design for safe evolution.

## API First

Design the API before implementation:

- Use the OpenAPI spec as the single source of truth for contract, docs, and tooling.
- Get early review (peers/architecture/security) before code hardens.
- Keep the spec in version control alongside the service code.

## Compatibility philosophy

Prefer compatible evolution:

- Add optional fields and additive endpoints rather than changing semantics.
- Avoid tightening validation for existing inputs in a way that breaks older clients.
- Ensure clients tolerate unknown fields and new enum values.

## Security by default

Secure and authorize early:

- Authenticate and authorize before processing request payloads.
- Never leak sensitive details in error messages or status codes.
- Treat public API paths as stable identifiers—avoid embedding tenant/customer identifiers.
