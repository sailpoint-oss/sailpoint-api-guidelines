# Pagination & filtering

List endpoints are one of the highest-leverage places to be consistent: pagination, sorting, and
filtering shape the client experience.

## When to use this guide

- You’re adding a list/search endpoint.
- You’re standardizing pagination behavior across APIs.

## Pagination: baseline expectations

- Always define a **stable default sort order** (pagination without stable ordering is not
  deterministic).
- Document defaults and limits (`limit` default and maximum).
- Make pagination behavior explicit in OpenAPI (parameters, response shape, examples).

## Recommended contracts

- Start with [Pagination recipes](/docs/appendices/pagination-recipes) for concrete request/response
  shapes.
- If you expect large or volatile datasets, consider cursor pagination; keep cursors **opaque and
  stable**.

## Filtering & searching

- Prefer straightforward equality and set membership filters for common use cases.
- If you need complex queries, document the query language clearly and provide examples.
- Avoid breaking changes: adding filters is typically safe; changing semantics is not.
