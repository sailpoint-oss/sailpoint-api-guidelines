# Design & review workflow

This guide describes a lightweight workflow for designing, reviewing, and publishing APIs using this
hub.

## When to use this guide

- You’re about to design a new API and want a consistent process.
- You’re reviewing an API change and need a shared checklist language.
- You’re consuming an API and want to understand what “good” looks like.

## Key idea: Rules are the contract; Guides explain how to apply them

- **Rules** are normative (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) and have stable numeric IDs you can cite.
- **Guides** are explanatory and pattern-oriented.
- **Appendices** are reusable reference/recipes (copy/paste contracts, checklists, glossary).

## For external readers (integrators)

- Treat the Rules as a **public checklist**: URL design, error handling, pagination, and auth patterns.
- If you find inconsistencies, include **the rule ID** in feedback (“this violates [#404]”) and link to
  the relevant rule section.

## For internal teams (designers/implementers/reviewers)

### A recommended workflow

1. **Start with a resource model**
   - Identify primary resources, identifiers, and relationships.
   - Sketch list/search shapes and expected filters/sorts.

2. **Write the OpenAPI contract first**
   - Keep OpenAPI as the single source of truth for contract + docs.
   - Add examples early (success + error).

3. **Run a structured review**
   - Review against the Rules category-by-category (URLs, payloads, errors, pagination, security).
   - Cite rule IDs in review comments for clarity and durable references.

4. **Implement and validate**
   - Ensure runtime behavior matches OpenAPI examples and descriptions.
   - Keep compatibility in mind: avoid breaking changes; evolve additively.

5. **Publish and maintain**
   - Document non-obvious decisions.
   - When changing behavior, include a compatibility note and migration guidance.

## Review checklist shortcuts

- Start with the [Review checklist](/docs/appendices/review-checklist).
- For deeper patterns, use:
  - [Error model & Problem Details](/docs/guides/error-model-and-problem-details)
  - [Pagination & filtering](/docs/guides/pagination-and-filtering)
  - [Idempotency & retries](/docs/guides/idempotency-and-retries)
