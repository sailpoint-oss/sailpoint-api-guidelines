# Guides

Guides are **non-normative**: they explain intent, patterns, and examples that help you apply the
[Rules](/docs/rules). If you’re looking for “must/should” requirements, start with the Rules.

## Choose a path

### If you’re integrating with SailPoint APIs (external readers)

- Start with [Conventions](/docs/conventions) to learn how to interpret “MUST/SHOULD/MAY” and rule IDs.
- Use Rules as a **contract checklist** (URLs, errors, pagination, auth) when evaluating an API.
- Use these guides when you need **practical patterns** and examples.

### If you’re building or reviewing SailPoint APIs (internal teams)

- Use Rules during **design**, **review**, and **implementation**—cite rule IDs in PRs and design docs.
- Keep OpenAPI as the **single source of truth** and ensure examples match reality.
- Use these guides to standardize contracts across teams and reduce reviewer burden.
