# OpenAPI authoring

High-quality OpenAPI is the fastest path to consistent APIs: it enables design review, documentation,
SDK generation, and automated checks.

## When to use this guide

- You’re designing a new endpoint or resource and need to structure the spec.
- You want to standardize examples, errors, pagination, and auth across APIs.

## Principles

- **Spec-first**: write OpenAPI before implementation hardens.
- **Examples are part of the contract**: examples must be realistic and match production behavior.
- **Reuse**: centralize shared schemas (errors, pagination envelopes, common types).

## Recommended structure

- Define reusable schemas under `components/schemas`.
- Define reusable errors under `components/responses` (or shared schema + per-operation response).
- Define security under `components/securitySchemes` and apply per operation as needed.

## Documentation hygiene

- Every operation should have:
  - a clear `summary`
  - a descriptive `description` (include edge cases and compatibility notes)
  - at least one success example and one error example
- Use `externalDocs` to link to supporting guidance (Rules/Guides) when a concept is too large to fit
  inline.
