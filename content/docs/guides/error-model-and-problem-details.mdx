# Error model & Problem Details

Consistent error responses reduce client guesswork and make failures easier to diagnose and handle.

## When to use this guide

- You’re defining error responses for new endpoints.
- You want consistent status codes + error payloads across APIs.

## Recommendations

- Use the most specific HTTP status code you can.
- Keep error payloads **stable** and **documented** in OpenAPI.
- Avoid leaking sensitive implementation details (stack traces, internal IDs, vendor exceptions).

## Problem Details (RFC 7807)

Problem Details provides a standard JSON shape (e.g., `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`,
`instance`) while still allowing extensions.

### Suggested usage pattern

- Use a stable `type` URI for each error category.
- Use `title` for a short human-readable category name.
- Use `detail` for request-specific details (safe to show to callers).
- Add extension fields for structured, machine-readable information (e.g. `errors[]` for field-level
  issues).

## OpenAPI guidance

- Document every error response per operation.
- Provide examples for common failure modes (validation, authz, conflict, rate limiting).
- Link to deeper reference where needed:
