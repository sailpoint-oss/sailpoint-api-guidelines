# Authentication, authorization, & scopes

Security needs to be consistent and clearly documented: clients should know what credentials are
required, what scopes are needed, and what failures look like.

## When to use this guide

- You’re adding OAuth requirements to an API.
- You’re defining scopes and want consistent naming and documentation.

## Recommendations

- Authenticate and authorize **before** doing expensive work.
- Document security requirements per operation in OpenAPI.
- Make authorization failures predictable (status code + error contract).

## Scope design (practical guidance)

- Prefer scopes that match **capabilities** (read/write/admin) for a resource domain.
- Avoid overly granular scopes that explode in number unless there is a clear governance need.
- Document what each scope grants and any important constraints.

## OpenAPI documentation tips

- Define `securitySchemes` once and reuse.
- Add operation-level `security` requirements.
- Provide error examples for auth failures.
