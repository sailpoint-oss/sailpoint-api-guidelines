# Conventions

## Normative language

These guidelines use RFC 2119 keywords:

- **MUST**: required for compliance.
- **SHOULD**: strongly recommended; exceptions must be justified and documented.
- **MAY**: optional; use when it improves client experience or operational safety.

## Rule IDs and stable references

Each rule heading ends with a stable numeric ID, e.g. `[#401]`. Rule IDs exist so you can:

- Reference rules in reviews and design docs (“violates [#404]”).
- Deep-link to a specific requirement.
- Automate checks (linters) against durable anchors.

## How to use this hub

- Start with **Rules** for normative “must/should” requirements.
- Use **Guides** for patterns and rationale.
- Prefer documenting decisions alongside the API spec (OpenAPI) and linking supporting docs via
  `externalDocs`.
