## Versioning & Metadata
<RuleHeader id="206" level="SHOULD" title="Avoid breaking changes as a strategy" />
### #206 - Avoid Breaking Changes as a Strategy

**Intent**: keep clients stable and reduce long-term operational burden.

Prefer **compatible evolution** over breaking changes. Do not treat “we can bump the version” as the default approach to making changes.

**Guidance**:

- Prefer additive changes:
  - add optional fields
  - add new endpoints
  - add optional query parameters with safe defaults
- Only introduce a new version when you have a clear, unavoidable breaking change and a migration plan.

**Common anti-patterns** (avoid):

- Breaking an endpoint and \"fixing\" it by bumping the version, even though the change could have been additive.
- Creating a new version without a deprecation timeline for the old one.

<RuleHeader id="207" level="MUST" title="Use path versioning when versions coexist" />
### #207 - Use Path Versioning When Versions Coexist

**Intent**: make version routing explicit and predictable for clients, gateways, and documentation.

If multiple API versions must coexist, represent the version in the **URL path** (URI versioning), e.g. `/v2026/...` or `/v3/...`.

**Why this approach**:

- Version is visible in logs, metrics, caches, and links.
- Simple routing at gateways and reverse proxies.
- Documentation can be hosted per version without ambiguity.

**Alternatives and tradeoffs** (why we avoid them by default):

- Header-based versioning (custom headers or media type params): less discoverable, harder to troubleshoot, often poorly supported by generic tooling.
- Query parameter versioning (`?version=`): easy to misuse and can create caching surprises.

**When versioning is warranted**:

- Only when you have unavoidable breaking changes and need old/new versions live concurrently.
- Prefer additive evolution when possible (see [#200] and [#206]).

**Examples**:

- ✅ `/v2026/accounts` and `/v2027/accounts`
- ✅ `/v3/accounts` and `/v4/accounts`
- ❌ `/accounts?version=3`
- ❌ `Accept: application/vnd.company.v3+json` (unless explicitly approved as an exception)

<RuleHeader id="208" level="MUST" title="Use year-based API versioning (YYYY.revision)" />
### #208 - Use Year-based API Versioning (YYYY.revision)

**Intent**: provide a clear, human-friendly versioning system that matches how APIs actually evolve.

APIs MUST use a year-based version identifier in the form:

- `YYYY.{revision}` (example: `2026.1`, `2026.2`)

**Definitions**:

- `YYYY` identifies the major contract line.
- `{revision}` increments when the **published contract** changes (additive or breaking), and is used for documentation/changelog purposes.

**Rules**:

- If multiple versions must coexist, use URI versioning (see [#207]) using the year line (e.g., `/v2026/...`).
- Within a version line, avoid breaking changes (see [#200]).
- Each `{revision}` MUST have a corresponding changelog entry describing contract changes and any migration/deprecation notes.

**What does NOT require a revision bump**:

- Implementation-only changes that do not change the published contract.

<RuleHeader id="214" level="MUST" title="Include API metadata" />
### #214 - Include API Metadata

**Intent**: ensure every API contract can be identified, categorized, and supported.

OpenAPI specifications MUST include complete API metadata under `info` and related top-level fields.

**Required**:

- `info.title`: human-friendly API name
- `info.version`: published contract version (aligned with [#208])
- `info.description`: what the API is for, key concepts, and link to guides
- `info.contact`: support/owner contact (team or distribution list)
- `servers`: at least one base URL (or environment template)
- `tags`: consistent tagging strategy for operations (at least one tag per operation)

**Strongly recommended**:

- `info.termsOfService` (when external)
- `info.license` (when external)
- `externalDocs` (link to developer portal / guides)
- `info.x-audience` (see [#215]) and any platform-required extensions

**Example**:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Identity API
  version: "2026.1"
  description: |
    Manage identities and accounts.
    See guides: https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/guides/...
  contact:
    name: Identity Platform Team
    email: identity-platform@sailpoint.com
servers:
  - url: https://api.sailpoint.com/v2026
    description: Production
  - url: https://{region}.api.sailpoint.com/v2026
    variables:
      region:
        default: us
        enum: [us, eu]
tags:
  - name: Accounts
  - name: Identities
```

**Testability**:

- Reviewers can locate owner/support contact and version quickly.
- All operations are tagged and the spec has at least one `servers` entry.

<RuleHeader id="215" level="MUST" title="Specify API audience" />
### #215 - Specify API Audience

**Intent**: make intended consumers and publication expectations explicit.

APIs MUST declare the intended audience in OpenAPI using `info.x-audience`.

**Allowed values**:

- `internal-company`: internal-only APIs
- `external-public`: customer/partner-facing APIs

**Guidance**:

- Audience affects publishing, support expectations, and compatibility rigor.
- Ensure the audience value matches how the API is actually exposed and documented.

**OpenAPI example**:

```yaml
info:
  x-audience: external-public
```

**Testability**:

- OpenAPI contains `info.x-audience` with an allowed value.

<RuleHeader id="216" level="MUST" title="Follow version requirements" />
### #216 - Follow Version Requirements

**Intent**: keep versioned APIs stable while allowing safe evolution.

For versioned APIs:

- Do not introduce breaking changes within a published major version line (see [#200]).
- Provide at least **2 years** of support for each major version line.
- Document versioning strategy clearly in the OpenAPI specification (see [#208], [#207]).

**What “support” means (minimum bar)**:

- The version remains available and documented.
- Critical security/availability fixes may be applied without changing the published contract.
- A sunset/deprecation timeline is communicated for retirement (see [#209], [#211], [#212]).

**Testability**:

- OpenAPI clearly identifies the version line and base path.
- Deprecation/sunset plans exist for versions that will be retired.

<RuleHeader id="217" level="MUST" title="Follow beta requirements when applicable" />
### #217 - Follow Beta Requirements When Applicable

**Intent**: make beta APIs usable while setting correct expectations about stability and support.

If an API (or endpoint/field) is **beta/preview**, it MUST follow these requirements.

## 1) Labeling (machine + human)

- Beta MUST be clearly visible in developer docs.
- Beta MUST be machine-readable in OpenAPI using a consistent extension (example):

```yaml
info:
  x-stability: beta
# or at tag/operation/schema granularity
```

## 2) Stability expectations

- Beta contracts MAY change in ways that would be considered breaking for GA.
- Teams MUST still aim for compatibility and MUST document any known churn areas.
- Do not “ship breaking changes silently”; publish changelogs for beta changes.

## 3) Support expectations

- Document the support model (SLA/response expectations) for beta.
- Document intended audience and any enrollment/whitelist requirements.

## 4) Migration to GA

- Provide a clear path to GA:
  - what “GA readiness” means (exit criteria)
  - expected timeline (even if approximate)
  - how beta consumers will be notified of GA

## 5) Compatibility boundaries

- Do not mix GA and beta semantics under the same endpoint without clear labeling.
- If only parts of a schema are beta (fields), label at field level and document behaviors.

**Testability**:

- OpenAPI includes `x-stability: beta` (or equivalent standardized extension) at the appropriate scope.
- Docs display beta status prominently and include support + migration guidance.

## Backward Compatibility
<RuleHeader id="200" level="MUST" title="Avoid breaking compatibility" />
### #200 - Avoid Breaking Compatibility

**Intent**: allow clients to upgrade safely without urgent rewrites.

Within the same major version, changes MUST remain backward compatible.

**Breaking changes (avoid within a major version)**:

- Remove or rename endpoints, fields, enum values, or query parameters.
- Change a field type or shape (e.g., `string` → `object`, array ↔ object).
- Change formats or constraints in a way that rejects previously valid data (e.g., tighter regex, smaller max length, new required fields).
- Tighten request validation when clients may already be sending additional fields.
- Change default behavior in a visible way (sorting, pagination defaults, implicit filters).
- Change authorization requirements for existing operations (new scopes/capabilities) without a compatible migration path.
- Change error contracts in a way that breaks parsing/branching (different media type, different envelope, removed fields).

**Compatible changes (generally safe within a major version)**:

- Add new optional response fields.
- Add new endpoints.
- Add new optional request fields with safe defaults (and server-side tolerance).
- Add new enum values only if clients are prepared to handle unknowns (see [#202]).

**Testability**:

- Spec diffs are reviewed for compatibility impacts.
- Clients/SDKs tolerate unknown response fields and unknown enum values.

<RuleHeader id="201" level="SHOULD" title="Prefer compatible extensions" />
### #201 - Prefer Compatible Extensions

**Intent**: evolve APIs by adding capabilities rather than mutating existing behavior.

When evolving an API, prefer **compatible extensions** over breaking changes.

**Examples of compatible extensions**:

- Add a new optional response field.
- Add a new optional request field with a safe default.
- Add a new query parameter that does not change behavior when omitted.
- Add a new endpoint instead of overloading an existing one.

**Examples that are often mistaken as compatible but can be breaking**:

- Adding a new enum value (server-compatible, but can break naive clients; see [#202]).
- Tightening validation (rejecting inputs that used to pass).
- Changing default sort order, pagination defaults, or implicit filtering.

**Guidance**:

- If behavior must change, prefer a new endpoint or a new major version rather than changing semantics in-place.

**Testability**:

- Proposed changes include a compatibility assessment (what clients might break and why).

<RuleHeader id="202" level="MUST" title="Prepare clients for extensions" />
### #202 - Prepare Clients for Extensions

**Intent**: ensure clients remain resilient as the API evolves.

Clients MUST be prepared for compatible server extensions.

**Client requirements**:

- Ignore unknown fields in responses.
- Tolerate new enum values (use an "unknown" fallback behavior).
- Handle HTTP status codes that are not explicitly documented for an endpoint.

**Examples**:

- **Unknown field**:
  - If the server adds `newField`, clients should continue parsing existing fields and ignore `newField`.

- **Unknown enum value**:
  - If a client expects `status` in `{ "ACTIVE", "INACTIVE" }` and receives `"PENDING"`, it must not crash; it should map to `UNKNOWN` or treat it as a safe default.

- **Unexpected status code**:
  - If a client receives `429` or `503`, it should follow documented retry/backoff guidance rather than failing with an unhandled exception.

**SDK guidance**:

- Avoid generated enums that throw on unknown values; prefer string unions or safe mapping with an `UNKNOWN` case.

**Testability**:

- Client tests cover unknown response fields and unknown enum values.
- Error handling includes a generic fallback path for unexpected status codes.

<RuleHeader id="203" level="SHOULD" title="Be conservative with inputs" />
### #203 - Be Conservative with Inputs

**Intent**: avoid accepting ambiguous inputs that create long-term compatibility traps.

Design request inputs conservatively and document constraints early.

**Guidance**:

- Define and document constraints explicitly (types, formats, length limits, required fields).
- Prefer clear, unambiguous shapes over "polymorphic" inputs that require guesswork.
- Be careful with unknown-field handling:
  - Rejecting unknown input fields can catch client mistakes early.
  - But changing from "ignore" to "reject" (or tightening validation) later can be a breaking change.

**Recommended approach**:

- Choose and document your unknown-field policy up front.
- If you need to tighten validation over time, do it with a migration path (warn first, document timelines, and consider new endpoints/versions).

**Examples**:

- If `limit` is accepted, document min/max and default.
- If a field is an enum, document how clients should handle unknown values.

**Testability**:

- OpenAPI documents constraints (e.g., `minLength`, `maxLength`, `format`, `pattern`, `minimum`/`maximum`).
- Validation behavior is consistent across endpoints and changes are reviewed for compatibility impact.

<RuleHeader id="204" level="MUST" title="Return top-level JSON objects" />
### #204 - Return Top-level JSON Objects

**Intent**: preserve evolvability and enable consistent metadata without breaking clients.

Responses MUST use a JSON **object** as the top-level structure (not a bare array). This keeps the door open to add metadata (counts, links, warnings, paging cursors) without changing the response type.

**Example**:

- ✅ list envelope: `{ "items": [ ... ], "count": 123 }`
- ✅ later add metadata (non-breaking): `{ "items": [ ... ], "count": 123, "links": { "self": "..." } }`
- ❌ top-level array: `[ ... ]`

**Notes**:

- `204 No Content` is still valid for operations that intentionally return no body.
- For error responses, use the standard error envelope (see [#404]).

<RuleHeader id="205" level="MUST" title="Treat OpenAPI objects as extensible" />
### #205 - Treat OpenAPI Objects as Extensible

**Intent**: enable additive evolution without breaking existing clients.

Object schemas in responses MUST be treated as **open for extension** by default. Servers MAY add new optional properties over time without requiring clients to upgrade.

**What this means in practice**:

- Clients MUST ignore unknown response fields (see [#202]).
- Servers MUST NOT make new fields required in existing responses.
- Enum sets may grow over time; clients must tolerate unknown enum values (see [#202]).

**Examples**:

- Additive field (compatible):

```json
{ "id": "123", "name": "Example", "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

- Additive links (compatible):

```json
{ "id": "123", "links": { "self": "/accounts/123", "owner": "/users/9" } }
```

- Enum expansion (server-compatible; client must be resilient):
  - Before: `status ∈ {"ACTIVE","INACTIVE"}`
  - After: server returns `"PENDING"`

**Testability checklist**:

- Clients ignore unknown response fields.
- Clients tolerate unknown enum values.
- Response bodies are top-level objects (not arrays).
- New optional fields do not change required/validation semantics.

## Deprecation
<RuleHeader id="209" level="MUST" title="Reflect deprecation in OpenAPI" />
### #209 - Reflect Deprecation in OpenAPI

**Intent**: make deprecations visible, machine-readable, and actionable for clients.

When deprecating any API element (operation, parameter, schema, field):

- Mark it as deprecated in OpenAPI (`deprecated: true`).
- Provide a clear migration path (replacement endpoint/field/version).
- Publish a sunset timeline (date) and link to migration documentation.

**OpenAPI example**:

```yaml
paths:
  /accounts/{id}:
    get:
      deprecated: true
      summary: Get account (deprecated)
      description: |
        Deprecated. Use GET /v2027/accounts/{id}.
        Sunset: 2027-06-30.
      externalDocs:
        description: Migration guide
        url: https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/guides/.../migration
      responses:
        "200": { ... }
```

**Docs requirements**:

- State **what is deprecated**, **what to use instead**, and **by when**.
- Call out any behavior differences clients must handle.

**Testability**:

- OpenAPI contains `deprecated: true` and migration guidance for deprecated elements.
- A documented sunset date exists and is communicated consistently.

<RuleHeader id="210" level="MUST" title="Monitor deprecated API usage" />
### #210 - Monitor Deprecated API Usage

**Intent**: enable safe retirement by knowing who still depends on deprecated behavior.

When an API element is deprecated (see [#209]), teams MUST monitor usage and proactively notify consumers.

**Minimum expectations**:

- Track calls to deprecated operations (and, where feasible, deprecated parameters/fields).
- Identify calling clients (token client ID, integration identifier, or other stable identifier).
- Maintain dashboards and alerts leading up to sunset.

**Recommended workflow**:

- At deprecation time:
  - announce deprecation, replacement, and sunset date
- During migration window:
  - notify top callers and provide migration support
- Before sunset:
  - escalate notifications and confirm readiness

**Testability**:

- There is a queryable metric/log dimension for deprecated usage.
- Ownership has a playbook for contacting consumers.

<RuleHeader id="211" level="SHOULD" title="Add Deprecation and Sunset headers" />
### #211 - Add Deprecation and Sunset Headers

**Intent**: provide machine-readable deprecation signals in live traffic.

When an endpoint is deprecated, APIs SHOULD include `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers in responses from that endpoint.

**Guidance**:

- `Deprecation` indicates the endpoint is deprecated.
- `Sunset` indicates the planned date/time the endpoint will no longer be available.
- Headers complement (but do not replace) OpenAPI `deprecated: true` + migration guidance (see [#209]).

**Example**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Tue, 30 Jun 2027 00:00:00 GMT

{ "id": "123", "name": "Example" }
```

**Testability**:

- Deprecated endpoints consistently return the deprecation headers.

<RuleHeader id="212" level="SHOULD" title="Have clients monitor Deprecation/Sunset headers" />
### #212 - Have Clients Monitor Deprecation/Sunset Headers

**Intent**: ensure clients learn about deprecations early and can plan migrations.

API clients SHOULD treat `Deprecation` and `Sunset` response headers as actionable signals (when present) and surface them to developers/operators.

**Client expectations**:

- Log and/or emit telemetry when `Deprecation` is present.
- If `Sunset` is present, record the sunset date and create an alert/ticket within the client owner team.
- For SDKs and shared client libraries, provide a common hook/middleware so application teams do not need to implement this repeatedly.

**Recommended behaviors** (examples):

- CLI / local dev:
  - warn once per endpoint per run when `Deprecation` is present
- Production:
  - count deprecated calls (metric)
  - alert when deprecated usage is non-zero past a threshold
  - alert when current date is within N days of `Sunset`

**Notes**:

- Presence/absence of headers MUST NOT be the only way clients learn about deprecation; specs and docs remain canonical (see [#209]).
- Clients MUST NOT ignore server-side deprecation just because headers are missing.

<RuleHeader id="213" level="MUST" title="Avoid new usage of deprecated APIs/features" />
### #213 - Avoid New Usage of Deprecated APIs/features

**Intent**: stop the spread of deprecated dependencies so retirement is possible.

Teams MUST NOT start new dependencies on APIs/features that are already marked deprecated.

**What “start using” means**:

- New code paths calling deprecated endpoints/fields.
- New integrations/clients adopting deprecated behavior.
- New tenants/environments enabling or onboarding onto deprecated versions.

**Exceptions**:

- Only allowed with explicit owner approval and a documented remediation plan (timeline + migration).

**Testability**:

- Reviews/CI checks prevent introducing new calls to deprecated endpoints (where feasible).
- Any exceptions are documented and time-bounded.

- [Appendices](/docs/appendices)

<RuleHeader id="218" level="SHOULD" title="Agree on deprecation timeframes with clients" />
### #218 - Agree on Deprecation Timeframes with Clients

**Intent**: choose deprecation windows that are realistic for consumers.

When planning to deprecate API features, versions, or behaviors, teams SHOULD collaborate with known clients to agree on reasonable deprecation timeframes.

**Guidance**:

- Prefer longer windows for external/public APIs than for internal-only APIs.
- If client coordination is not possible, publish a conservative default window and provide an escalation path.
- Always publish the sunset date and migration guidance (see [#209]).
