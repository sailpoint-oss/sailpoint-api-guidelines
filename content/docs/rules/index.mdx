description: Normative, ID-backed rules for designing consistent SailPoint APIs.
---

This section contains the current rule set. For now, it preserves the legacy rule wording while we refine and modernize the guidance.

## How to use the Rules

- Each rule has a stable ID (e.g., `[#401]`) so you can cite it in reviews and deep-link to it.
- Rules are normative (“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”). Use [Guides](/docs/guides) and [Appendices](/docs/appendices) for patterns and rationale.
